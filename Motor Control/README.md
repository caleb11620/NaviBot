This folder will hold all software regarding the motor control.

Necessary Deliverables:

- [ ] Fabricate motor mounts that will connect the motors to the PCB. This mount can also provide some structural support to the PCB if you design it in. Look at Altium to see the board layout and for measurements. Refer to datasheets for mechanical drawings of components. Design in Fusion Autodesk 360 and then convert into a Cura file.
- [ ] Arduino Motor Control software with commands(FWD, LEFT, RIGHT, etc.)

These  deliverables must be completed and functional by September 15th, 2024.
