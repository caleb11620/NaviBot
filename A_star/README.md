This folder will hold all software regarding the A* solution algorithm.

Necessary Deliverables:

- [x] A* Code that will solve a 10x10 C++ grid maze will output solution steps (September 10th)
- [ ] A* Code that will solve a BIN file maze and will output solution steps (September 25th)
- [ ] A* Code that will convert from solution steps to heading and distances that the bot can follow (October 4th)

These three (3) algorithms must be completed and functional by October 4th, 2024
