This folder will hold all software regarding the encoder.

Necessary Deliverables:

- [ ] Arduino code that will utilize the counter found in the ATmega328p chip. The encoder is attached to this input and will allow us to count the pulses coming into the Arduino. (September 6th)
    
- [ ] Arduino code that will convert the encoder count into a distance traveled. This code must also be able to reset as to not cause overflow into the counter. (September 8th)

- [ ] Fabricated mount to hold the encoder and adapter to connect the motor drive to the encoder (September 15th)

These  deliverables must be completed and functional by September 20th, 2024.
